# Bank Customer Churn Analysis Report in Power BI

Overview

This project aims to analyze and understand customer churn within a banking context. By utilizing Power BI, we conduct an end-to-end process to develop and publish a comprehensive Customer Churn Analysis report.

Dataset

We use a Bank Customer Churn dataset containing various attributes such as customer demographics, account information, transaction history, and churn status.

Process

  Data Connection: 
  
  We begin by connecting the Bank Customer Churn dataset to Power BI to access the required data.

  Data Preparation: 
  
  The dataset undergoes preprocessing steps, including cleaning, filtering, and transforming the data to ensure its suitability for analysis. like changing the Data Types, making columns meaningful example age column was a discrete column converted that to continous column for making it more meaningful.

  Data Modeling and Analysis: 
  
  We perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, correlations, and insights related to customer churn. This involves creating data models and conducting statistical analysis to understand factors influencing churn.

  Data Visualization: 
  
  Utilizing Power BI's visualization capabilities, we design interactive dashboards and reports to present our findings visually. Visualizations include charts, graphs, and maps to effectively communicate churn trends and patterns.

  Report Sharing and Distribution: 
  
  Once the analysis and visualization are complete, we share the report with stakeholders for review and decision-making. Power BI enables easy sharing and distribution of reports through various channels.

Benefits

  Insightful Analysis: 
  
  By leveraging Power BI's capabilities, we gain deeper insights into customer behavior and churn drivers.
  Data-Driven Decisions: 
  
  The analysis empowers stakeholders to make informed decisions aimed at reducing churn and improving customer retention strategies.
  Efficient Reporting: 
  
  Power BI streamlines the process of creating, sharing, and distributing reports, facilitating seamless collaboration among team members.
  
Conclusion

  Through this project, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Power BI in conducting Customer Churn Analysis within the banking industry. The insights gained contribute to enhancing customer satisfaction and optimizing business performance.
